# tinykv

A toy project to learn how variants of key-value stores work. The idea is to implement all the major data structures that key-value stores use.


## Variants (Key-Value Store)
- hashing
    - [ ] chaining
    - [ ] open addressing
- sorting
    - [ ] AVL tree (balanced binary tree).
    - [ ] Treap (randomized binary tree).
    - [ ] Trie (n-ary tree).
    - [ ] B-tree (balanced n-ary tree).
    - [ ] Log structured merge tree (sorted arrays).
